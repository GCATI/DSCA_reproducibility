# that the test DF would be based on the same distribution.
# Pclass, relatively fewer 1st class passengers. Majority are 3rd class.
# Age, floating point. Estimated ages include a .5 value. There is a degree of
# missingness, only 714 observations. What proportion is missing? What
# proportion is estimated?
# Sibsp, number of siblings or spouses aboard. Mistresses and fiances were
# ignored. Majority recorded having no siblings. Mean is higher than median,
# large outliers influenced? Max is 8 siblings.
# Parch, number of parents / children on board. Children travelling with nanny
# only Parch == 0. Large outlier influence on mean as in SibSp.
# Fare, minimum is zero. How many? Are these the crew? Do they have a unique
# pclass and age profile? Mean is double the median, high large outlier
# influence. Maximum is Â£512, whopping for 1912.

#summary stats for object columns

# =============================================================================
# Name column has no duplicates, I happen to know the full dataset has 2 non
# unique values. Either in test df or split. Likely of no consequence for this
# analysis.
# Sex appears to be mostly male. Look at proportion male:female.
# ticket ref is object, column is a mix of character / numeric values.
# Interestingly, 230 values are non-unique - family tickets?
# Cabin number has a high degree of missingness. Only 204 values. This is a
# shame as it would have been very interesting to analyse survival based on
# distance from the deck level. Perhaps isolate this group and investigate?
# Embarked - port of embarkation has 3 values. Most common one is S =
# Southampton.  2 missing values here.
# =============================================================================

the method of splitting the test dataset. No detail on how this has been done

correlation with Survival neither of which would be indicated as strong
(corr of 0.7 or higher) all other numeric feautures indicate weak negative
correlations against survived suggests a lot of noise in observed trends in
features against survival. Weak though they are,the largest coefficients
observed (+ or -) against survived are Pclass & Fare. Within the matrix as a
whole, Pclass & Fare has the strongest observed coefficient of -0.549500
Not a strong correlation though (+/-0.7 threshold). A moderate negative
correlation. Next up would be SibSp & Parch with a weak positive correlation
of 0.414838.'''
